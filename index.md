<div style="text-align: justify"> Using graph analysis, analyze the instagram data set available in Kaggle to find out the most influential members of the network to increase sales by advertisement. The dataset was too large to process, we therefore had to do exploratory data analysis to check how to reduce it so that it doesn't become a random network.</div>

Our goal is to teach the Lunar Lander (our agent) how to correctly land their spaceship between two flags (our landing pad). The more accurately the agent is able to land, the bigger the ultimate reward he will be able to attain. The agent may choose any of the following four actions at any moment to achieve this objective: fire the left engine, fire the right engine, fire down the engine, or do nothing.

### üöóTraining AWS Car üöó
The goal was to create a custom reward function so that the AWS Deep Racer completes an unseen track as fastest as possible, and as accurately as possible. An example of a reward function would be:


```python

def reward_function(params):

    # Reward weights
    speed_weight = 100
    heading_weight = 100
    steering_weight = 50

    # Initialize the reward based on current speed
    max_speed_reward = 10 * 10
    min_speed_reward = 3.33 * 3.33
    abs_speed_reward = params['speed'] * params['speed']
    speed_reward = (abs_speed_reward - min_speed_reward) / (max_speed_reward - min_speed_reward) * speed_weight
    
    # - - - - - 
    
    # Penalize if the car goes off track
    if not params['all_wheels_on_track']:
        return 1e-3
    
    # - - - - - 
    
    # Calculate the direction of the center line based on the closest waypoints
    next_point = params['waypoints'][params['closest_waypoints'][1]]
    prev_point = params['waypoints'][params['closest_waypoints'][0]]

    # Calculate the direction in radius, arctan2(dy, dx), the result is (-pi, pi) in radians
    track_direction = math.atan2(next_point[1] - prev_point[1], next_point[0] - prev_point[0]) 
    # Convert to degree
    track_direction = math.degrees(track_direction)

    # Calculate the difference between the track direction and the heading direction of the car
    direction_diff = abs(track_direction - params['heading'])
    if direction_diff > 180:
        direction_diff = 360 - direction_diff
    
    abs_heading_reward = 1 - (direction_diff / 180.0)
    heading_reward = abs_heading_reward * heading_weight
    
    # - - - - -
    
    # Reward if steering angle is aligned with direction difference
    abs_steering_reward = 1 - (abs(params['steering_angle'] - direction_diff) / 180.0)
    steering_reward = abs_steering_reward * steering_weight

    # - - - - -
    
    return speed_reward + heading_reward + steering_reward

```
